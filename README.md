# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware ‚Äì PCs
2. Anaconda ‚Äì Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. First, import the lu_factor and lu_solve functions from the scipy.linalg module. These functions are used to perform LU decomposition and solve linear systems using LU decomposition, respectively.
2. Use the eval(input()) function to take user inputs for matrix a (the coefficient matrix) and vector b (the right-hand side vector). These inputs should be entered in a format that Python can interpret as arrays, like lists of numbers.
3. Use lu_factor(a) to compute the LU decomposition of matrix a
4. Use lu_solve((lu, piv), b) to solve the linear system

Ax=b where A is the matrix a, x is the solution vector, and b is the right-hand side vector. This function returns the solution vector X.
